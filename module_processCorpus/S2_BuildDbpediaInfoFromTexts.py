# input: a .s file or a folder
#			if folder, it is supposed to be the CORPUS base folder, and folder/files_s_p_w must exist, and all '.s' files in folder/files_s_p_w will be processed
# outputs: several files will be created in folder/files_s_p_w
#			a file with '.s.p' extension for each processed file
#			a .s.p.html file with the entities marked in green

# IMPORTANT: the identification of entities in DB-SL is done with parameters 'confidence=0.5' and 'support=1'
